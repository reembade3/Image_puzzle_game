# AI Image Puzzle Solver using BFS and Greedy Algorithms

This C# project is an image puzzle solver that utilizes two AI search algorithms - Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Greedy Best-First Search. These algorithms enable efficient solving of image puzzles by intelligently searching through the solution space.

## Features

- **Image Shuffling:** Users can shuffle the pieces of the image to create a puzzle.
- **BFS Algorithm:** The project implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm to systematically explore possible puzzle configurations until a solution is found.
- **Greedy Algorithm:** Additionally, the Greedy Best-First Search algorithm is used to prioritize puzzle configurations based on heuristic evaluation, allowing for faster solving in certain scenarios.
- **Win Detection:** Once the puzzle is solved, the program detects and notifies the user of the successful completion.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Build the solution to compile the project.

## Usage

1. Run the compiled executable or start the project from your IDE.
2. Choose puzzle size and either the BFS or Greedy algorithm for solving the puzzle from start form.
3. Select an image to use for the puzzle.
4. Shuffle the pieces of the image to create the puzzle.
5. Watch as the program systematically solves the puzzle using the selected algorithm.
6. Once the puzzle is solved, the program will notify the user.
